This is a  MERN (MongoDB, Express Js, React Js, Node Js) based full stack Social Media Website.

Here you can search users, send/accept/reject friend requests, remove or chat with frineds. 

Chakra UI is used to build the layout.

To use the code:-

1. You need Node Js to be installed in your PC.
2. Make your own MongoDB cluster by visiting their official website and copy paste the connection url to a new folder i.e .env in the server folder as MONGO_URL="link".
3. In that folder only, set a new key-value pair as JWT_SECRET="anything you want" and then PORT=3002.
4. Now in the terminal, change directory to client as well as server and type npm install.
5. Now in client directory, type "npm start" and in server directory, type "node index.js".
6. And you are good to go :)
